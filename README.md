# Clustering-with-DBSCAN-Polynomial-Regression
It contains two pairs of datasets and notebooks - one pair for clustering & the other pair for regression. For clustering Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) was applied and an f1 score of 0.97 was attained. For the regression problem, K-Fold Cross Validation was implemented for determining the best degree polynomial fit. An RMSE of 0.85 was reached with a 10 degrees polynomial for regression.
